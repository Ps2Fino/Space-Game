Space-Game
==========

A small game in SDL. Why not sure :-)

Uses CMake. Beware though, the CMakeLists.txt file is optimized for Mac really (I haven't had the time to try cross compilation for windows)

Dependencies
============

+ SDL 2.0.3 (>= 2.0 should be fine)
+ SDL Image (SDL_image.h)
+ SDL TrueType Font (SDL_ttf.h)
+ SDL Mixer (SDL_mixer)
+ Boost (a modified version of boost containing just the smart pointer header only library and its dependencies is included with the source)
